to revert a commit,
git revert <commit_number>

you csn get the commit number by
git log

then identify which commit you want to revert.
then you will get commit window
press 'i' to write any message about your reverting commit
then press 'esc' to escape from insert mode, then to SAVE and EXIT
press ':x!' and hit 'enter' (:x! will take the cursor to the bottom, and hitting enter exits the commit window).

now after all these, the old file can be seen in your local machine repository
not in the remote repository, since you dint commit the reverted or old file after reverting the commit.

So to see those changes in remote repository, 
		> stage the file (git add .)
		> commit the file (git commit -m "message")
		> push the old file to see the reflected changes in remote repo (git push)
		> now you cna see the changes in remote repo
